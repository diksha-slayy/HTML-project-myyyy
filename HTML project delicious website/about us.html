            About Us
       
    </h1>
        <p><i><b><u><b>Delecious Bites</u></b> is relaxed, simple and elegant.<br>
         From the dining room’s muted tones and white tablecloths to the ever-changing offerings steeped in<br>
          traditional flavor pairings and techniques —  it is both a neighborhood restaurant as well as a celebratory destination.<br>
           Our menu changes daily, featuring seasonal, simple food with influences from korean and Italy and indian also.<br>
            At Delecious Bites, wrote Pete Wells in his 2018 review,<br>
          “what you really notice is how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional.”</b></i></p>
